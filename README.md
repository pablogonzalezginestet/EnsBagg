## Important Note

The real data application in the paper relies on Swedish HIV care register (InfCareHIV) that cannot be openly shared. The data available on the folder contain fake, simulated  data that mimics the data used for the analysis. The R scripts in this repository are the same as those used for the analysis, but analysis results cannot be exactly reproduced.
