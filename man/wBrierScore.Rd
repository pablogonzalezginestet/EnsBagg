\title{IPC Weighted Brier Loss Function}
\usage{
ipcw_brier(par, Z, y, wts)

\arguments{
\item{par}{a vector of weights. Its length must be equal to the number of predictions included in Z}

\item{Z}{a matrix that contains the predictions. Each column represents a single marker.}

\item{y}{vector of response variable (binary).}

\item{wts}{IPC weights}
}
