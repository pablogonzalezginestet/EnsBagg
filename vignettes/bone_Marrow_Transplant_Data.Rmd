## Introduction

We apply the package __ensBagg__ to a data set The Bone Marrow Transplant Data (bmt) which is in the package __timereg__ . Bone marrow transplants are a standard treatment for acute leukemia. In the recovery process patients can suffer from Infections, toxicity, and (after allogeneic HSCT only), graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD) being  the main causes of death. We are interested in predicting  the time to death related to treatment where the risk of relapse is a competing risk. 

## Setup

We load the package __ensBagg__ and __timereg__ and we load the data set bmt

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(ensBagg)
library(timereg)
data(bmt)
```
